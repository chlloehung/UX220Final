    <section>
        <h2>The pros of PNG compared to JPG</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first pro is lossless compression as PNG ensures that image quality is preserved without losing any details.</li>
            <li>The second pro is that it's a great choice for detailed graphics as it's well-matched for images containing high contrast and very intricate details.</li>
            <li>The third pro is its ability to support a wide range of colours, which makes it suitable for many types of images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The cons of PNG compared to JPG</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first con is that PNG fils can be larger in size than JPG files which would make it less convenient for web use when the size of files is important.</li>
            <li>The second con is that it is less efficient when compressing images--especially comparing it to JPG, thus making it not ideal for photographs.</li>
            <li>The third con is that although PNG supports transparency, some older browsers may have difficulty properly displaying transparent areas within the PNG images. As a result, there may be difficulty in compatibility which would require additional considerations when aiming for a wide range of browsers. </li>
        </ul>
