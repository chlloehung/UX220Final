        <p>The form might not work on GitHub pages as it needs HTTPS for security. If the form uses HTTP instead of HTTPS in the action attribute, it may be blocked due to mixed content restrictions. </p>
        
        <h2>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/</h2>
        <p>This form should work on GitHub pages as it uses HTTPS, which is just like the secure version of regular HTTP. It follows all the security rules that GitHub pages has in place. </p>
